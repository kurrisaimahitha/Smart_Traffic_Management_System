## Overview

This project employs Deep Learning and Object Detection techniques to facilitate intelligent traffic monitoring and management. The system utilizes ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) and ATCC (Automatic Traffic Counting and Classification) to:

- Optimize traffic flow
- Minimize congestion
- Improve road safety

## Core Functionalities

- Recognition of vehicle license plates (ANPR)
- Classification and control of traffic (ATCC)
- Data interpolation for improved detection accuracy
- Generation of video outputs with traffic annotations

## Technologies and Tools

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Listed in `requirements.txt`
- **Deep Learning**: Object detection models such as YOLO

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- All necessary Python libraries (refer to `requirements.txt`)

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kurrisaimahitha/ANPR_And_ATCC_For_Smart_Traffic_Management_System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd ANPR_And_ATCC_For_Smart_Traffic_Management_System
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Update the `.env` file with your secret keys.

## How to Use

1. Generate the initial detection CSV file by running `main.py`:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - The generated file will be saved in the `results/` folder.

2. Perform data interpolation using `add_missing_data.py`:
   ```bash
   python add_missing_data.py
   ```
   - The interpolated CSV file will be saved in the `interpolated_results/` folder.

3. Visualize the results by executing `visualize.py`:
   ```bash
   python visualize.py
   ```
   - The annotated video output will be saved in the `output/` folder.
